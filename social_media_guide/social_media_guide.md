# Social Media Guide
_June 2020_


## Should my chapter participate in social media ?

- Yes, we encourage our members to utilise social media platforms if they are able to.
- PyLadies dominant social media channel is Twitter. We have a global account, [@PyLadies](https://twitter.com/pyladies) and most PyLadies chapters have their own Twitter
account. 
- NOTE: if you would like your post to be shared via @PyLadies, please submit the [Tweet from PyLadies form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdHpN0awyxlzKVgxpBhJgcOtqFymp_Lrs_DO_ueHO8fB0hcCw/viewform)

## Getting Started

### Social Media use guidelines and code of conduct:

** The chapter accounts should be used to promote:**

Posts
- The work (e.g open source, blog posts, academic research) of individual PyLadies
- PyLadies events and announcements for your chapter
- Quality Python resources and tutorials even if they're not written by a PyLadies member
- We encourage posting photos from events!
- We love images, animated gifs and emojis as a form of expression!
- Feel free to retweet posts by others that promote PyLadies work and events as well.
- Do not make political statements with your chapter account **_unless_ the @ThePSF and @PyLadies have taken a political stance**. Otherwise, please use your personal
Twitter for political speech.
- Always speak positively about people’s work.
- Do not use your chapter account as a personal account: no personal tweets or massive
self-promotion
   - Feminist or women-in-tech related topics are okay, but please stay away from
traditional politics, as that can be divisive to the community and PyLadies is a
non-partisan organisation
   - When tweeting, do not use the word “I”, always use “we”
   - It’s okay to promote the #Python related work/projects of PyLadies, including
yourself, just don’t over-do it and don’t promote work that’s not directly related
to Python or PyLadies.
  - No selfies (we encourage group pictures instead).
- Do not promote products or any other commercial offerings.
  -  Promoting open source Python projects that are backed by a company is okay.
  -  Thanking a meetup host/sponsor for their support is okay.
Engagement
- Tag all of your tweets with the #PyLadies hashtag. This makes them searchable and more visible
- On tagging @PyLadies: please do that if you are referring to the global organisation. If you want to refer to PyLadies in general, please use the hashtag.
-  Please add further hashtags to #PyLadies in the following situations:
   - If your chapter has a visitor from another chapter, please take a photo and share
it on Twitter using the hashtag, #PyLadiesvisits
   - If you are sharing pictures of PyLadies themed baked goods (cakes, muffins,
cookies, etc), treats or merchandise, consider adding #PyLadiesSwag
   - If you are tweeting about PyLadies in Brazil, please consider adding #PyLadiesBrazil.
