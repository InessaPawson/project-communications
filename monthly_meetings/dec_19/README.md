## Notes 

- How are we approving new members to GitHub? Check out Python PSF work groups for ideas (we are calling these teams instead of work groups)
- https://www.python.org/psf/committees/#code-of-conduct-work-group
- Look at mission and responsibilities to see if they make sense
- How are we communicating? Slack? Github? Can use github issues to start discussions and volunteer to work on issues you’re interested in
