# PyLadies Project: Communications

The proposal for this project can be found [here](https://github.com/pyladies/global-organizing/issues/42).

### Mission

A team to handle the Global PyLadies Communication and Engagement work. Work includes managing comms as it relates to interchapter communication and managing digital assets (e.g. blog, Slack). As such, Project lead(s) should include at least one seasoned PyLadies Chapter organizer, however team members can be any self-identifying PyLadies member.
