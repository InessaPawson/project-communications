# User manual for me

- This is inspired by the work of [Cassie Robinson](https://medium.com/@cassierobinson/a-user-manual-for-me-d3a851fbc694) and it's a great way for us to get to know each other and also learn more about how to work together in the best way possible.
- Using the template below, please create your own _**User Manual**_ and add the link in the table below.
